With this revolving line of credit, you only borrow as you need the money. You have the option to pay off your balance each month, or you can pay down your balance over time, depending on your situation.

It’s important to note, though, that when you carry a balance from month to month, you’ll pay an interest fee. Depending on your credit situation, this fee can be higher than what you would pay with a personal loan. However, if you can pay down your balance regularly, you’ll be less likely to need to worry about interest.
